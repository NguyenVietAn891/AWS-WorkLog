The deployment and operational process plays a decisive role in delivering the product to users quickly, stably, and easily. For this Desktop application, the deployment process has been optimized to provide the smoothest installation experience possible.

## 1. Deployment and Packaging Process
The application is built on a hybrid platform combining a web interface (React/Vite) with a desktop application core (Electron). The packaging is automated using Node.js tools:

- **Step 1 - Frontend Compilation:** The React source code, UI components, and static resources are built and optimized into static files.
- **Step 2 - Electron Packaging:** Using the **electron-builder** tool, the system bundles the Node.js backend core, the compiled frontend, and the internal Chromium browser together.
- **Step 3 - Build Executable:** By running the command **npm run build:desktop** in the terminal, the entire source code is compressed and compiled into a single executable installation file (in **.exe** format for the Windows operating system).
- **Benefits:** This packaging process ensures that the application can run completely independently (Standalone) on the user's machine without requiring them to pre-install Node.js, programming environments, or any other supplementary software.

## 2. Distribution and Download
Since this is a Desktop application project for personal and internal learning purposes, distribution is extremely simple and direct:
- After the **Setup.exe** installation file is successfully built, it is uploaded to a cloud storage system (Google Drive).
- Users simply need to access the shared Google Drive link and click to download the **.exe** file.
- The file size is optimized so that the download process is fast, even with standard internet connections.

## 3. Installation and Usage
The usage process is designed to be user-friendly, even for non-technical users:
- **Installation:** The user double-clicks the downloaded **.exe** file. The application will automatically install on the machine (in the AppData or Program Files directory depending on the configuration) and automatically create a shortcut icon right on the Desktop.
- **Launch:** Opening the application from the Desktop icon will launch the login interface.
- **Login & Experience:** Users log in using their provided account (or register a new one). Afterwards, they can immediately use all the features of the application: managing study time (Pomodoro), interacting with the AI Assistant, caring for virtual pets, and completing the daily quest systems.

## 4. Maintenance and Updates
In the future, when new features or bug fixes are added:
- Developers simply re-run the **npm run build:desktop** command to create a new **.exe** distribution release.
- Users download the new version from Google Drive and safely install it over the old version without losing account data or learning progress (since the data is synced and stored on the cloud database/server).
- Local settings (API keys, preferences) are preserved on the user's computer (in a separate configuration directory).
